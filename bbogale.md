# Brief Summary
The ricing community is a subculture within the linux space that loves 
to create custom themes for linux setups. This ranges from simple color 
adjustments to entire revamps of the linux system. The themes are generally 
split into two camps. There are window manager themes, which include things 
like i3 and AWESOME, and there are desktop enviroment themes that cover things 
like GNOME and KDE.

# What is the problem
The subreddit for displaying custom made themes by people across the internet is
called UnixPorn. It serves to show screenshots of themes people create along with 
links to the files needed to replicate them. As it currently stands there is no
effective and intuitive way to filter through the various themes submitted by the 
community and replicate them with ease. This project wished to create a website to
solve just that.

# The feature this website will have are as follows
- Catalogue of themes that the user can filter and sort
    1. Sort by popularity
    2. Sort by date uploaded
    3. Sort by type [DM/WM]
    4. Sort by distro (maybe)
- Information page for selected theme
    * Who it was submitted by
    * Shows the type [DM/WM]
    * Base system needed to replicate the theme
    * A link to the github repo featuring all the neccessary files

# Language/Toolsets
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Flask (backend)

# Who is this for?
This is mainly an application towards the UnixPorn community along with
anyone that has an interest in linux ricing.
