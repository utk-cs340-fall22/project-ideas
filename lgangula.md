# Summary
An app will be created to help employees at hybrid offices (remote and in-person x days a week) to reserve desks/cubicles. Reservations will be made public and other employees will be able to see future days reservations.

# Problem
I interned at a company that was hybrid between remote and in office, and their system for reserving desks was slightly annoying. A better way to reserve desks/cubicles as well as see what days other employees are coming in would be great for productivity. Some teams had a whiteboard, which increased team morale, but an app would be even better.

# Features
- Reserve desks at different building.
- see other reservations
- reserve multiple days at a time, or a scheduled reservation
- request other users to move/message them
- some sort of calendar integration so employees can coordinate when they come in

# Languages,tools, etc:
- Python/PyQt or flutter/firebase
- outlook or google calendar
- SQL if not firebase/futter

#audience
Employees that are not required to come to the office. Hybrid work environments are the target audience, but this can be extended to students in smaller classes at universities. Any group that attends some sort of event without formal seating, and excess seats could also use this app.
