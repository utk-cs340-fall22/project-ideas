##Project Idea
To build a chess engine of roughly 1600-2000 Elo strength.

##Major Features
A GUI of a chess board with an engine running in the background to generate computer moves.
I think that the project could be developed in the following phases:

1. Board GUI
2. Move generation for a given position (including castling, en passant, pawn promotion, etc.)
3. Minimax search for the best move, then use alpha-beta pruning and a quiessence search
4. More specific details dealing with openings, endgames, pawn structure, etc.

With just a simple minimax search, the computer will play pretty reasonably. Everything after that
will just make it much better than the average human chess player.

#Languages/Tools to be Used
-C++ for the engine
-JavaScript for the GUI

##Problem Being Solved/Who Would Use this?
Chess engines have been around for a while and this obviously won't be the best one so it won't
have much practical value in terms of being an actual product. I just think that it would be a
fun and interesting project to work on.
